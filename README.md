## Skinet
E-commerce application built using Angular and ASP.Net Core WebAPI, with Stripe payment integration.

### Origins
This repository contains code written while completing the Udemy course [Learn to build an e-commerce app with .Net Core and Angular](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-build-an-e-commerce-app-with-net-core-and-angular) written by Neil Cummings.

My code will contain minor changes, although I plan to make some more extensive additions in the future.
